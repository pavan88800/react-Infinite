## NOTE:-

## ✅ window.scrollY:-

## What it does:-

It gives you the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled vertically from the top.

## Example:

If the user scrolls down by 300 pixels, window.scrollY will be 300.

## Use case:

You use this to check how far the user has scrolled down the page.

---

## ✅ window.innerHeight

## What it does:

It gives you the height of the browser's viewport (the visible part of the page).

## Example:

If your screen can display 800 pixels vertically, window.innerHeight will be 800.

## Use case:

You use this to know how much content is visible at once.

---

## ✅ document.body.scrollHeight:-

## What it does:

It gives you the total height of the document, including the parts that are not visible without scrolling.

## Example:

If the entire page content is 3000 pixels tall, document.body.scrollHeight will be 3000.

## Use case:

You use this to check how tall the page is and compare it to how much the user has scrolled.

## ✅ Putting them together

The condition in your code:

```js
if (window.scrollY + window.innerHeight >= document.body.scrollHeight) {
  // load more content
}
```

## means:

`* window.scrollY + window.innerHeight *` → how far you've scrolled from the top + the visible height of the window → this tells you how far the bottom of the visible area is from the top of the page.

`* document.body.scrollHeight *` → the total scrollable height of the document.

When the sum of scrollY and innerHeight is greater than or equal to scrollHeight, it means the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page (or close to it).

---

## ✅ Why this is useful in infinite scrolling

You want to know when the user reaches the bottom of the page so you can load more content before they run out of items to see. This condition efficiently detects that moment!
